In order to compile the plug-in from sources, you also need to download the
KeePass 1.x sources that match the plug-ins base version number from the
"Other Downloads and Resources" section at

    http://keepass.info/download.html

and extract the archive. Under the directory where you extracted the KeePass 1.x
sources to, on the same level as the "Build", "Docs", "Ext" etc. directories,
you have to create the "Plugins\OublietteImport" directory where you copy
these files (and contained directories and files) to. The structure should then
look something like this:

    KeePass
     |
     +-Build
     |
     +-Docs
     |
     +-Ext
     |
     .
     .
     .
     |
     +-Plugins
     |  |
     .  +-OublietteImport
     .     |
     .     +-Data
           |
           +-Source

The plug-in depends on the Crypto++ library, which get automatically pulled-in
as an SVN external when checking out this source code. If you need to manually
download Crypto++ for some reason, use the most recent tagged version available
at:

    http://cryptopp.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cryptopp/tags/

The "c5" module is what you need to checkout. Compile the static version of the
library named "cryptlib", rename the debug version library from "cryptlib.lib"
to "cryptlibd.lib", put it to a common directory with the release version, add
this directory to the library paths, as well as adjusting the include paths.

Now the Oubliette plug-in should find both the required KeePass 1.x and Crypto++
files and compile fine.
