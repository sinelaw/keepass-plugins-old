In order to compile the plug-in from sources, you also need to download the
version matching KeePass sources from

    http://keepass.sourceforge.net/download.php

and extract the archive. Under the directory where you extracted the KeePass
sources to (that is parallel to the "Build", "Docs", "Ext" etc. directories)
you then have to create a "Plugins\OublietteImport" directory where you copy
these files and directories to. The structure should then look something like
this:

    KeePass
     |
     +-Build
     |
     +-Docs
     |
     +-Ext
     |
     .
     .
     .
     |
     +-Plugins
     |  |
     .  +-OublietteImport
     .     |
     .     +-Data
           |
           +-Source
