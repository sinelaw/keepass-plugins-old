In order to compile the plug-in from sources, you also need to download the
KeePass sources that match the plug-ins base version number from

    http://keepass.sourceforge.net/download.php

and extract the archive. Under the directory where you extracted the KeePass
sources to, on the same level as the "Build", "Docs", "Ext" etc. directories
you have to create the "Plugins\OublietteImport" directories where you copy
these files and directories to. The structure should then look something like
this:

    KeePass
     |
     +-Build
     |
     +-Docs
     |
     +-Ext
     |
     .
     .
     .
     |
     +-Plugins
     |  |
     .  +-OublietteImport
     .     |
     .     +-Data
           |
           +-Source

Moreover, you will need to download the Crypto++ library. As the time of
writing, a version of Crypto++ that will compile with Visual Studio 2005 is
available in CVS only:

    http://cryptopp.cvs.sourceforge.net/cryptopp/c5/

The "c5" module is what you need to checkout. Compile the static version of the
library named "cryptlib", rename the debug version library from "cryptlib.lib"
to "cryptlibd.lib", put it to a common directory with the release version, add
this directory to the library paths, as well as adjusting the include paths.

Now the Oubliette plug-in should find both the required KeePass and crypto++
files and compile fine.
