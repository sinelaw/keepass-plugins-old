This is an Oubliette (http://oubliette.sf.net/) import plug-in for KeePass
(http://keepass.sf.net/). Most recent versions of this plug-in can be found at

    http://keepass.sourceforge.net/plugins.php#oubimport
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=95013&package_id=183336

Please follow the instructions at

    http://keepass.sourceforge.net/plugins_info.php

in order to install the plug-in. Plug-ins are only guaranteed to work with the
version of KeePass they were compiled for. If you try to run a new version of
KeePass with a plug-in that was compiled for an older version, KeePass will
issue a warning. If you load the plug-in nontheless you may risk to get crashes
and all kinds of strange effects.

I hope you find this plug-in useful.
