This is an Oubliette (http://oubliette.sf.net/) import plug-in for KeePass 1.x
(http://keepass.sf.net/). Most recent versions of this plug-in can be found at

    http://keepass.info/plugins.html#oubimport
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=95013&package_id=183336

Please follow the instructions at

    http://keepass.info/help/v1/plugins.html

in order to install the plug-in. Plug-ins are only guaranteed to work with the
version of KeePass 1.x they were compiled for. If you try to run a new version of
KeePass 1.x with a plug-in that was compiled for an older version, KeePass 1.x will
issue a warning. If you load the plug-in nontheless you may risk to get crashes
and all kinds of strange effects, but it may also work just fine.

If you find this plug-in useful and it helped you to save some time, please
