This is an Oubliette (http://oubliette.sf.net/) import plugin for KeePass 1.x
(http://keepass.sf.net/). Most recent versions of this plugin can be found at

    http://keepass.info/plugins.html#oubimport
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=95013&package_id=183336

Please follow the instructions at

    http://keepass.info/help/v1/plugins.html

in order to install the plugin.

Since KeePass 1.15, plugins do not need to be recompiled for each new KeePass
release. This means you can safely use a plugin designed for KeePass 1.15 with
e.g. KeePass 1.16 or higher.
