In order to compile the plug-in from sources, you also need to download the
KeePass >= 1.15 sources from the "Other Downloads and Resources" section at

    http://keepass.info/download.html

and extract the archive. Under the directory where you extracted the KeePass
sources to, on the same level as the "KeePassLibCpp" directory, you have to
create the "Plugins\OublietteImport" directories. To that directory, copy the
files from this archive. The structure should then look something like this:

    KeePass-1.15-Src
     |
     +-Build
     |
     .
     .
     .
     |
     +-KeePassLibCpp
     |
     +-Plugins
     |  |
     .  +-OublietteImport
     .     |
     .     +-Source

The plug-in depends on the Crypto++ library, which gets automatically downloaded
as an external when checking out the source code from SVN. If you need to manually
download Crypto++ for some reason, use the most recent version available at:

    http://cryptopp.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cryptopp/trunk/

The "c5" module is what you need to checkout. Compile the static version of the
library named "cryptlib", rename the debug version library from "cryptlib.lib"
to "cryptlibd.lib", put it into a directory together with the release version, add
this directory to the library paths, and also adjust the include paths.

Now the Oubliette plug-in should find both the required KeePass and Crypto++
files and compile fine.

Happy compiling,
